Here are some common information.
The collaboration project between Piaggio and Daihatsu involved in the creation of a joint-venture with a capital of thirty billion Lire of which 51% will be in the hands of Piaggio and 49% will go to the Japanese Daihatsu. The minivans will be built in Piaggio 's Pontedera factories and the expected investment is approximately 150 billion Lire, of which 65 will be borne by the joint venture. According to the indications illustrated in 1990, by the Pontedera assembly lines, 35.000 vehicles are expected to come out per year for a total turnover of 350 billion per year. Twenty thousand will be sold in Europe and North Africa by Piaggio while the other 15 thousand will be marketed directly by Daihatsu in the UK and ASEAN Market. The new small commercial vehicle, called Porter for the European market that would allow the Italian manufacturer to offer a larger and more capable alternative to the classic Piaggio Ape.[1]

Here is how it is made.
Made by Piaggio in Pondera Italy

Here are some fun facts.
The definitive model went into production in Pontedera in September 1992 and was marketed on the European market in the spring of the following year (both as Piaggio Porter and as Daihatsu Hijet on some Asian and UK market).[2] Much of the mechanics components were produced by Daihatsu in its factories in Japan and assembled in Italy by Piaggio. The Porter was developed starting from the japanese keivan Daihatsu Hijet S80, using the same frame and the same sheet metal but the front section has been redesigned and strengthened using reinforced steels to withstand crash tests for European homologations. The interior is also totally new. [3]

The initial three versions were: a panel van for the transport of goods, a glazed van with 4 seats for the transport of people and pick-ups, all equipped with a three-cylinder petrol engine of 1000 cm³ produced by Daihatsu. An additional version is the ambulance version intended above all for Italian villages with access difficulties. [4]

In 1995 the versions with diesel engines were presented, equipped with a 1200 cm³ four-cylinder engine produced by Lombardini. In the same year, the petrol version was changed, now equipped with multipoint electronic injection and catalytic converter, and a fourth version, Porter Tipper, a pick-up with tipper platform, was made available in both engines.[5]

Subsequently, a version with all-wheel drive 4x4 was also made available in the petrol engine alone. The versions equipped with an internal combustion engine are also accompanied by a version equipped with an electric motor. The 4 and 6 seater glazed van versions were also marketed between 1994 and 1997 by Innocenti as Innocenti Porter.

Here are some conclusions.

It is a great small van for cities and towns and it's cab over layout makes for easy parking and driving.
