Mild Ale (or Beer)

Overview

Mild ale is a type of ale. Modern milds are mostly dark-coloured, with an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 3% to 3.6%, although there are lighter-hued as well as stronger milds, reaching 6% abv and higher. Mild originated in Britain in the 17th century or earlier, and originally meant a young ale, as opposed to a "stale" aged or old ale.

Here are some common information.
"Mild" was originally used to designate any beer which was young, fresh or unaged and did not refer to a specific style of beer. Thus there was Mild Ale but also Mild Porter and even Mild Bitter Beer. These young beers were often blended with aged "stale" beer to improve their flavour. As the 19th century progressed public taste moved away from the aged taste; unblended young beer, mostly in the form of Mild Ale or Light Bitter Beer, began to dominate the market.

Modern dark mild varies from dark amber to near-black in colour and is very light-bodied. Its flavour is dominated by malt, sometimes with roasty notes derived from the use of black malt, with a subdued hop character, though there are some quite bitter examples. Most are in the range 1.030–1.036 (3–3.6% abv).

Here is how it is made.
Use a single-step infusion mash at 152–154 °F (66.7–67.8 °C) for the
dark mild or 153–155 °F (67.2–68.3 °C) for the pale mild for 1–1.5
hours. Sparge one hour, with water no hotter than 175 °F (80 °C),
until run-off reaches SG 1.010–1.012. Boil 90 minutes, with bittering
hops added at the start. Strain, or siphon off from the hops, and adjust
wort volume with cold water, and cool to about 70 °F (21 °C). Pitch
with yeast starter, and allow to ferment. By 5–7 days, final gravity
should have been reached; rack into a glass fermenter. One week later,
rack again, prime with dried malt extract, and rack into keg or bottles.
To ensure good fermentation, it is best to make a half-gallon starter
of the original yeast culture.


Here are some fun facts.
Nowadays, we think of mild ales as the lowest-strength English beers,
but that was a later development. In the latter half of the eighteenth
century, a particular brewer often charged more for his mild ale than he
did for his pale or bitter ale. One publication of the 1880’s lists
Burton Mild with an OG of 1.080 (19.3 °P), compared to bitter at 1.064
(15.7 °P). Around the turn of that century, mild ales were still being
brewed at gravities of 1.055–1.060 (12.4–14.7 °P) on average. By this
time, porter had almost entirely disappeared in England, and the most
popular beers were pale and mild ales, with the latter predominating.
From around 1900 onwards, there was a general decline in strength in
British beers. This may have been a gradual trend anyway, as a result of
an 1880 Act of Parliament that taxed beers according to their original
gravity. But a drastic acceleration came during the First World War,
with the average original gravity of all beers falling as low as 1.031
(7.8 °P) by 1918. This was partly due to a shortage of raw materials,
and partly because the government limited both the volume and strength
of beer which individual brewers could produce.
Beer strengths in Britain did increase after World War I, but they were never to return
to pre-war levels. Even today the average original gravity is only
around 1.038 (9.5 °P). It took a while, since many breweries still
brewed more than one mild, but bitter soon became the stronger of the
two for a given brewer. More to the point, after World War II, bitter
became increasingly popular, as tastes changed and drinkers became more
affluent. The position of mild was not helped by it gaining a reputation
for being the beer to which the publican added back all the slops
collected during serving. It wasn’t helped either by other tricks
practiced by unscrupulous brewers, such as producing a very light
bitter, then coloring part of the beer with brewer’s caramel and calling it
mild ale.


Here are some conclusions.

“Mild ale is the lowest of the low!” “Mild ale is dead!” In Britain,
where it originated, it is seen as weak, uninteresting and
old-fashioned. It has the reputation of being a “cloth cap” beer, drunk
by the sweaty working classes as they swarmed out of the factories and
coal mines, eager to slake their thirst after long hours of hard
physical labor.
Mild is generally the lowest-strength beer in
any brewer’s portfolio. It is often very difficult to find, especially
in London and the South-East of England. The bigger brewers are not
interested in brewing a slow-selling, low-volume beer. And publicans are
not interested in selling a beer that has low turnover and does not
keep well in cask because of its low strength.
Bitter ales and pale lagers are now the most popular beers in Britain, and mild ale
makes up only about 3% of total draught beer consumption. Many see mild
ale as, if not already extinct, at least a highly endangered species.
Some brewers have succeeded in increasing poor sales of mild by simply
renaming it, leaving out the word “mild” all together. And CAMRA (The
Campaign for Real Ale) has run promotions for some years making May a
“Drink Mild” month, in order to keep the beer going. It wasn’t always
that way, though. From around the end of the nineteenth century until
just after the Second World War, mild ale was the most popular English beer.
